-- Absenteeism At Work Project --

I analyzed employee health data (smoking, alcohol, absenteeism) to identify correlations between unhealthy habits and absenteeism, ultimately aiming to improve employee well-being. This analysis revealed peak absenteeism on Mondays and during March and July. I used insights from the study were used to recommend targeted interventions (smoking cessation, stress management) for improved health.
