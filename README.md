Absenteeism At Work

This project analyzed a dataset of employee health data to identify patterns and relationships between various factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, absenteeism, and health outcomes. The goal was to gain insights into employee health and identify potential areas for improvement.
The analysis revealed several key findings, including:
Smoking and alcohol consumption were associated with increased absenteeism. Employees who smoked or drank alcohol were more likely to miss work than those who did not.
There was a strong correlation between absenteeism and health outcomes. Employees who missed work more often were more likely to experience health problems, such as heart disease and stroke.
Absenteeism was highest on Mondays. This suggests that employees may be more likely to take sick days on these days.
Absenteeism was highest in March and July. This suggests that employees may be more likely to take sick days during these months, possibly due to the cold weather or holiday stress.
The analysis of employee health data revealed several important findings. These findings can be used to improve employee health and well-being by implementing targeted interventions, such as smoking cessation programs and stress management workshops.
